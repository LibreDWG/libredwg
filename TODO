* add object_refs for 2007
* add bit_read_MCU type for 2010 bitsize
* pre-R13: tables, entities, block entities
* PROXY subentities, PROXY_ENTITY
* CELLSTYLEMAP TABLE_Cell struct
* DIMSTYLE_CONTROL: one R2000+ RC missing
* LEADER: associated_annotation, dimstyle handles (untested)
* undocumented and apparently unused: LONG_TRANSACTION, DUMMY
* SPATIAL_INDEX class/object untested

  the sections have now multiple pages.
* encode for 2004+: move the local structs to the dwg, as union.
* finish DXF writing (easy)
* add DXF reading (easy)
* add binary DXF

* fix the remaining leaks.
* check 32bit/64bit strictness with the public headers (internally we can handle it).
* enhance and document the API functions.
* add the basic DWG layout and API to the docs.
* add more defaults when encoding from older to newer versions.
* automate windows nightlies and binary releases via appveyor,
  POSIX releases via travis => github (savannah?).
* check testsuite errors when cross-compiled under wine.
  latest wine needs a new WINEARCH env var.
