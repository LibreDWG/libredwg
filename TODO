* R2010+: fix some remaining objects
* pre-R13: finish entities, block entities
* PROXY subentities, PROXY_ENTITY
* CELLSTYLEMAP TABLE_Cell struct
* DIMSTYLE_CONTROL: one R2000+ RC missing
* SPATIAL_INDEX class/object untested
* WIPEOUTVARIABLE class/object untested
* link VBA_PROJECT object to its section, and vice versa
* ACIS: implement parsing of SAT file version 2,
  in ACIS entities 37, 38 and 39
* convert XRECORD xdata linked-list ResBuf to array of eed[],
  same structure as common EED.

* merge decode_r2007 with the 2004 decoder. It is almost the same, just
  the sections have multiple pages. Only for this version. 2010+ uses
  the 2004 format.
* encode for 2004+: move the local structs to the dwg, as union?
* finish DXF writing (easy, see the json branch)
* add DXF reading (easy)
* add binary DXF (see the json branch)
* add getopt_long() for position independent options
* add make target: manual

* fix the remaining leaks.
* enhance and document the API functions.
* add the basic DWG layout and API to the docs.
* add more defaults when encoding from older to newer versions.
* build releases via travis => github (savannah/ftpupload)?
* check testsuite errors when cross-compiled under wine.
  latest wine needs a new WINEARCH env var.
* check for a waiver/copyright assignment from
  Alex Papazoglou <papazoga> for his reed-solomon code (yet unused).
  Otherwise use rscode-1.3 by Henry Minsky <hqm@alum.mit.edu> which is GPLv3.
