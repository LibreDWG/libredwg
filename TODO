  ARCALIGNEDTEXT  DOCUMENTOPTIONS NPOCOLLECTION
  POINTCLOUD RTEXT XREFPANELOBJECT
* add test coverage - i.e. an extended example_2018.dwg with all types,
  for the following missing entities:
  BODY CAMERA DIMENSION_ANG3PT DIMENSION_DIAMETER
  DIMENSION_RADIUS DUMMY DGNUNDERLAY DWFUNDERLAY
  GEOPOSITIONMARKER IMAGE LEADER LONG_TRANSACTION MINSERT
  OLE2FRAME OLEFRAME POLYLINE_2D POLYLINE_MESH
  PROXY_ENTITY PROXY_LWPOLYLINE SHAPE

  NPOCOLLECTION OBJECT_PTR PLOTSETTINGS PROXY_OBJECT

* check-dxf/outdxf: DXFIN coverage for all generated dxfs. some objects even crash acad:
  VERTEX_3D, MLINE.
* DXFIN errors:
  Drawing_2007-18: XRECORD starting at line 5318: Could not set the Color dictionary:
  *2010: Updating handle seed. Invalid or incomplete DXF input
  *2007: XRECORD read error
  example_2000: REGION starting at line 2506: Xdata wasn't read
  Drawing_2000_min: crash at AcDbLine

* convert XRECORD xdata linked-list ResBuf to array of eed[],
  same structure as common EED.
* link VBA_PROJECT object to its section, and vice versa
* merge decode_r2007 with the 2004 decoder. It is almost the same, just
  the sections have multiple pages. Only for this version. 2010+ uses
  the 2004 format.
* encode for 2004+: move the local structs to the dwg, as union?
* finish binary DXF (easy). cross-check via: filedia 0, dxfout => Binary
* finish GeoJSON http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html
  ELLIPSE, ARC, CIRCLE: needs segmentation into lines
  MLINE, SPLINE, MINSERT, SOLID, TRACE, RAY(?), XLINE(?)
* maybe dwgfilter, as from the osmctools, with keep and drop rules.
* check osm tools https://gitlab.com/osm-c-tools/osmctools how
  they could import GIS data easier.
  Check OpenStreetMap XML and PBF formats.
* add one of the easy OGR formats: gml, gpx. See the xmlsuite which does it also.
  See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Dxf2gpx
  https://grass.osgeo.org/grass74/manuals/v.in.dxf.html and dwg (teigha and opencad)
* add more geom.c utils to tessellate curves (e.g. GeoJSON)
* ACIS: Maybe convert binary SAB to ASCII SAT version 2 (ASM ShapeManager,
  forked from ACIS 7.0)
* map DWG constraints to FreeCAD and SolveSpace constraints
  https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Sketcher_Workbench#Sketcher_Constraints
* check valabind vapi files to generate more and better bindings
  (e.g. radare2-bindings). c++, c#, rust, go, node, java, perl, ruby, php,
  autolisp (via ARX).
  Did so, I dislike it. Too much work, valabind crashes and requires glib and gobject.
  See the work/vapi branch.
* add some UI to inspect the DWG internal structs (dwgiview), and maybe a viewer (dwgview).
  Started with perl-tk

* fix the remaining leaks: indxf
* finish documentation of the API functions, refman.
* add the basic DWG layout and API to the docs.
* add fuzzing and solver-based test generation (bits)
* check testsuite errors when cross-compiled under wine.
* check for a waiver/copyright assignment from
  Alex Papazoglou <papazoga> for his reed-solomon code (yet unused).
  Otherwise use rscode-1.3 by Henry Minsky <hqm@alum.mit.edu> which is GPLv3.
