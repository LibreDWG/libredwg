	The 2nd .y coord was wrong. Found by @soundd1 [GH #40].

2018-08-30  luzpaz  <luzpaz@users.noreply.github.com>

	Misc. typos and whitespace fixes
	Found via `codespell -q 3`.

2018-08-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

        Release 0.6

2018-08-12  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	free: not the static strings
	but all the others

	free: DECODE_UNKNOWN_BITS
	free the unknown_bits

	free: DEBUG_HERE_OBJ

	decode: clean vectors
	calloc them, not just malloc.

	dxf: more empty vector protections
	in this case ASSOCNETWORK

	dxf: fix -Wpointer-to-int-cast warning

	encode: protect empty vectors
	with DEBUGGING or UNSTABLE classes vectors
	can easily be unallocated

	encode: BITCODE_BL sizes

	configure: keep CFLAGS on --enable-debug
	e.g. -I/usr/local/include is needed for dwgps
	just remove -O2

	dxf: cast SURFACE to 3DSOLID

	dwggrep: add new objects

2018-08-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	beautify valgrind version

	fix -Wstringop-truncation in strncpy
	strncpy specified bound 255 equals destination size

	fix -Wdouble-promotion, use our bit_isnan
	don't use the math.h long double promoting isnan check,
	at least on clang.

	add separate signed BLd type #36
	We just changed BL to signed. revert that and add a separate BLd to represent the two such dxf ranges.
	BL as signed is a problem for vcount/rcount overflow detection with negative values.
	Closes GH #36

	unknown: add DEBUGGING ACSH_SWEEP_CLASS ACDBNAVISWORKSMODELDEF
	ACSH_SWEEP_CLASS is probably the dbSweepOptions.h class
	no coverage for ACDBNAVISWORKSMODELDEF (BIM_DICT entries)

	add examples/bits: all possible values/types
	not just the most likely as with bd

	bd: print most possible types and values

	rm duplicate logs.sh and log.sh
	we already have log and logs-all.sh

2018-08-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add examples/bd
	to print the BD value of bits

	move HELIX to UNSTABLE
	found all the missing fields. It's a spline.
	bd-unknown.inc helped a lot.

	unknown: add some bd-unknown doubles
	they do work

2018-08-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add examples/bd-unknown.inc
	to fixup wrong binary repr. of doubles,
	if found by some manual heuristic

	this is the initial empty set of all wrong BDs (with removed
	duplicates)

2018-08-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dwggrep: skip 3DSOLID encr_sat_data
	This makes not much sense, rather search the decrypted variant.
	It also read from uninitialized memory

	make regen-swig-patch

2018-08-09  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: integrate 3DSOLID into SURFACE
	search for "ACIS BinaryFile" revealed an ordinary ACIS v2 SAB format
	right at the beginning of each SURFACE.
	Ensure a common binary layout for both, as we cast the SURFACE into 3DSOLID
	for decoding.

	Update 0.6 NEWS

2018-08-08  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: LDADD and LTEXEC fixes for shared
	link to bits and common explicitly. most functions there are not exported.

	fix LTEXEC: use unexpanded \$top_builddir. This is needed for a Makefile and a script.

2018-08-08  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: LIGHT looks good now
	fix plot_glyph, color,
	no hole left.

	unknown: regen-unknown

	alive.test: skip libtool on --disable-shared

	skip Unstable|Unhandled Class warning
	on print or free action. Only relevant for
	decode or encode really

	support non-decode for common_entity_data.spec
	enable encode and DXF support.
	simplify CMC color fields: rgb and alpha masks

	unknown: re-sort per file
	keep the objects from one file together

	fix parallel picat
	skip libtool --mode=execute on --disable-shared
	fix the dirname of examples/unknown with libtool.
	fix parallel picat

2018-08-07  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	skip incompatible moreutils parallel
	this does not support the {} and ::: syntax,
	rather uses -- for arg separation, and I still have to find out
	the {} and {/.}_{//} macros.

	we want the GNU parallel (in perl)

2018-08-07  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add log script
	usage: ./log -v5 2004/Leader example_2000

	use parallel and timeout as probed
	use logs-all-serial.sh or logs-all-parallel.sh

	probe for PROGS versions
	not just to the log, display it.
	picat, timeout, parallel, valgrind.
	add timeout, parallel probes.

	more EMC tryouts WIP

	unknown: fix cquote final 0
	cquote forgot to close dest, leaving garbage in some strings.
	e.g. \"%sn\">%..." in ACDBSECTIONVIEWSTYLE.pi

2018-08-07  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add new EMC color type
	for new truecolor support in entities.

	Also, regen-unknown fixed several wrong xdicobjhandle handles in
	ACDBDETAILVIEWSTYLE objects.

2018-08-07  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: work on VISUALSTYLE colors WIP
	actually the color.index is always 0 >= r2004.
	the dxf value needs to be derived from the first rbg byte somehow.

2018-08-06  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	trace CMC.flag always
	>=2004 a CMC always contains the index, rgb and flag. print that to detect wrong
	CMC colors, i.e. flags != 0,1 or 2.

	mingw: test too many args

	picat: expect also Most probable result
	which is at the end of definite and probable results.
	we don't want it to be killed before printing any result

	unknown: fix membits overflow
	found when overflowing possible and found bits.
	off-by-one bitsize: when setting 2 bits at 215 with 216 bits avail,
	it needs to set 215 and 216. so we really need to check against 217 (215+2).

	unknown: fix pi_fn stack overflow
	with path + ACDB_DYNAMICBLOCKPURGEPREVENTER_VERSION
	it easily exceeds 80

	unknown: fix the possible/found logic
	set the bits from pos to the end of bitsize

	unknown: fix num_filled stats
	fixing the wrong summary count e.g. 292/281=103.9% for PDFDEFINITION

2018-08-05  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: re-add missing objects
	we forgot to add DECODE_UNKNOWN_BITS for TABLE* objects.
	just MULTILEADER is now done.

	unknown: harmonize object/entity format
	and bitsize

	unknown: fix HAVE_INSRCDIR check
	for make -C examples regen-unknown.
	builddir is empty, ac_builddir ditto. srcdir=. is enough

	unknown: check picat for Definite result
	otherwise keep the old log. prevents bad logs from overwriting
	old logs

	windows -Wformat: fix type
	REPEAT_CHKCOUNT_LVAL(name,_obj->times,type)
	warning: format '%ld' expects argument of type 'long int', but argument 5
	has type 'long long unsigned int' [-Wformat=]

	unknown: next refactor
	delete pre_bits, this was wrong. It starts uneven already.
	rather store the useful relative handle and string offsets/sizes.

	add ASSOCPLANESURFACEACTIONBODY to UNSTABLE
	similar to ASSOCDEPENDENCY

2018-08-04  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add 2nd FIELD_CMC dxf2 arg for rgb value
	matching pairs 62-420, ...

	decode: improve color tracing

	work on VISUALSTYLE WIP
	add and set about 50% of the missing fields

	unknown: re-order in-work area in the spec
	separate UNSTABLE from DEBUGGING

2018-08-04  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: refactor 2/2 and regen-unknown
	now got rid of all the slack, and we can regen-unknown even with DEBUG_CLASSES.
	summary went from 142504/2939403=4.85% to 502764/2623166=19.17%

	regen added VISUALSTYLE and many other UNSTABLE classes

2018-08-04  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	move VISUALSTYLE back to UNSTABLE
	~480 bits missing

	refactor UNKNOWN_FIELDS/DECODE_UNKNOWN_BITS
	dwg_decode_unknown() helper, used not only for UNKNOWN_OBJ/UNKNOWN_ENT
	but for all unstable classes.
	change to one single bits array with pre bits (if it starts not at bit 0),
	and num_bits (the bitsize in bits).

	free: fix UNKNOWN with empty dxfname
	on free checking an empty dxfname leads to SEGV.
	eg:
	{size = 91, address = 416360, type = 515, index = 240, fixedtype = DWG_TYPE_UNUSED,
	  bitsize_address = 0, has_strings = 0 000, stringstream_size = 0, handlestream_size = 0,
	  supertype = DWG_SUPERTYPE_UNKNOWN, tio = {entity = 0x0, object = 0x0, unknown = 0x0},
	  dxfname = 0x0, bitsize = 0, hdlpos = 0, handle = {code = 0, size = 0, value = 0},
	  parent = 0x7fff5fbfe0c0, common_size = 0}
	bypass dwg_free_variable_type for UNKNOWNs.

2018-08-04  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add signed BLs type (420,440), fix DBCOLOR
	add a special int32_t BLs type just write the codes 420,440,
	i.e. the DBCOLOR rgb value.
	rename FIELD_BLh to FIELD_BLx and add more hex types.

	promote DBCOLOR to UNSTABLE. The remaining unknown bits are bogus,
	there's no CMC color field, no duplicate catalog $ name fields.
	Just the BLx rgb field needs to mask off the first byte for DXF,
	and there's a unknown RC. The DXF color index 21 is missing, this
	might be computed.

2018-08-03  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: more DBCOLOR work

	unknown DBCOLOR: split 430 name and catalog
	in DXF combined, in the DWG split up

	move DYNAMICBLOCKPURGEPREVENTER to UNSTABLE
	the last remaining handles were bogus, they do not exist
	The fiest code 70 BS looks like a class_version, but this really
	would be code 90. Who knows.

	improve UNKNOWN_{ENT,OBJ} logging to -v3
	no -v5 needed anymore.
	regen-unknown with some changed handles.

	fix bit_write_RL/bit_write_BL
	if <0 > 255 makes not much sense.
	handle large negative values, detected by unknown BL node_edge1 -1 values.

	move LIGHT to UNSTABLE
	just a few unknown internal fields are remaining,
	but the known DXF fields are done.

	unknown: regen with new byte sizes
	and without LIGHT (see next commit).
	less overshoots into the next object

	Fix -v5 overshoot errors
	store the size of the common entity/object data, until the
	object specific fields start. for a proper UNKNOWN_*.num_bytes size.
	Note that bitsize does not include the size of the common handles, so we start
	counting at obj->address, but obj->common_size starts counting after the type,
	so we still overshoot by ~18

	unknown: more work on LIGHT WIP

	fix rad2deg computation
	only needed for dxf and unknown

	unknown: skip common_entity_data
	for alldwg_1.inc. no such layer/color fields, which are
	handled in common_entity_data.spec and are not dumped
	into UNKNOWN_OBJ bytes at all, hindering the search

2018-08-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: finish UNDERLAY
	found remaining fields via picat/unknown,
	some RC/BS confusion.
	simplify clip_boundary and harmonize to clip_verts.

	move to UNSTABLE, passes all PDF coverages.
	but no DGN nor DWF coverage yet.

2018-08-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	regen-unknown

	unknown: skip common_entity_data
	there was one case of layer "0" found as TF, which was illegal

	unknown: regen for new Underlay_2004

	rename normal/210 to extrusion
	for consistency

	unknown: work on PDFUNDERLAY
	WIP

	unknown: fix dupl. go1 target

2018-08-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dwgread: declare setenv
	via stdlib.h

2018-08-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	Fix dejagnu.h linkage
	probe for -fgnu89-inline and use it.
	See https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla//show_bug.cgi?id=63613
	Fixes [GH #2]

	Add dejagnu to cygwin and ubuntu/travis. msys2 dejagnu is not picked up,
	macos not tested on travis.

2018-08-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	more bit_write_RL_tests fixes
	this time I got all the swapping right.
	enhance the RL testcase using 4 different bytes

	dxf: implement dxf_classes_read()

	VALGRIND_SUPPRESSIONS: fix make dist
	EXTRA_DIST needs a relative pathname,
	Cannot stat ".//Users/rurban/Software/libredwg/valgrind-darwin.supp",
	note the ./ prefix

	testcases: oops bits_test read_RL
	another off-by-one

	dxf: more null-ptr protections

	check programs: use libtool
	with --enable-shared

2018-08-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add VALGRIND_SUPPRESSIONS, check-valgrind programs
	integrate check-valgrind into alive.test,
	add more valgrind flags to check-dwg-valgrind.

	suppressions:
	on linux-glibc bash leaks like hell:
	  GNU bash, version 4.4.23(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
	on darwin the libc locale subsystem and objc.

	on the bright side: Most LibreDWG leaks are fixed.

2018-07-31  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	move MULTILEADER to UNSTABLE

	finish MULITLEADER >= 2010
	though there are 92 bits missing before the handle stream

	regen-swig-patch

	change BITCODE_BL/RL to signed int32
	harmonize all vcount/i counters and sizes to BITCODE_BL.

	finished MULTILEADER <2010

	more MULTILEADER work WIP
	share ctx.content.txt and ctx.content.blk: either or.
	2000 works now until end CONTEXT_DATA

	more MULTILEADER work WIP
	multiple breaks.
	start with 2010+ AcDbObjectContextData at the beginning

	more MULTILEADER work WIP
	actually coming closer back to the ODA specs.
	add back num_vertex, num_break

	more MULTILEADER work WIP
	disable to fantasy ODA structs and code.
	favor the DXF docs, structure and reverse-engineered data.

	work on MULTILEADER WIP
	class_version 1 has at first the LEADER_LINE{ points.

	fix entity picture_size BLL type
	lshift one too many. size used as DXF code 160.
	This fixes now 2010+ MULTILEADER entities, which did have a small picture attached.

	regen unknown
	added MLeader*.dwg for MULTILEADER, BoxUnion.dwg for REGION ACIS v2.
	removed UNSTABLE DIMASSOC, ASSOCDEPENDENCY, PERSSUBENTMANAGER.

2018-07-30  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	Improve LOG_TF trace
	Align the 2nd ASCII line to the left of the upper %2x hex line

	Improve {VECTOR,REPEAT}_CHKCOUNT macros
	detect buffer overflows, if AVAIL_BITS() < 0.
	Change AVAIL_BITS to signed long.
	This happens if the previous read (e.g. TF) read past the buffer

	parse the ACIS version 2 format
	It is just the unencrypted binary SAB version.
	Maybe I will decode it to the ASCII variant later, but it is trivial,
	and the binary version has higher precision.

	add handle stream/padding OVERSHOOT warnings
	log OVERSHOOT instead of MISSING when we read too far

	add handle stream/padding overshoots MISSING
	padding between the streams should be max 8.
	display the offset, and add MISSING if >8

	separate WINEPREFIX for wine 32bit
	keep the default 64bit tree at ~/.wine, and create/use
	a new 32bit one.
	This test finds many useful errors.

	in_dxf: fix -Wnull-dereference warning

2018-07-29  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix --enable-debug
	overriding AM_CFLAGS is ignored, DEFS also.
	use CFLAGS.
	Just override -g -O2 on gcc --enable-debug, ignore -std=c99 also then.

	rename UNTESTED_CLASS to UNSTABLE_CLASS
	it really is tested, just unstable

	update NEWS - user-visible changes for 0.6
	working on 0.6

	decode: fix wrong has_strings offset
	fixes many skipped r2007+ strings, because of a wrong has_strings
	bit.
	Fixes [GH #34]

2018-07-29  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode: check obj_has_strings(type)
	and skip the obj_string_stream() has_strings bit check
	for certain fixed types which do have no strings.
	e.g. LINE and SEQEND entities had the has_strings bit wrongly set,
	they just need to be ignored.

	See [GH #34]. libdxfrw sets their string stream to NULL.

2018-07-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	remove unused duplicate reactors/xdicobjhandle
	They are already common object/entity fields.
	Remove them from the specific structs.

	Also remove the wrong dwg_obj_proxy_get_reactors() API,
	use dwg_obj_get_reactors() instead.

2018-07-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	MINSERT: harmonize with INSERT
	use SUBCLASS,
	better DXF layout, no attrib_handles without has_attribs

	unknown: more work on LIGHT
	got until attenuation_end_limit

2018-07-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: cquote C strings again
	log_unknown_dxf.pl already quotes " and \,
	but since unknown emits picat code, we need to do it again.

	failed only in ACDB*VIEWSTYLE template strings and MULTILEADER.

2018-07-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	smoke.sh: new features
	--enable-write is now default,
	cover the other new features: --disable-write, --disable-dxf, --enable-debug

	semver: separate patch from build number
	the appveyor build number goes into the generated github tag
	which serves as our git generated version number.

2018-07-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix DIMASSOC
	it has 1-4 reference points, dependent
	on the associativity bitmask. alloc all 4, and
	set only the ones which bit is set.

	Associativity flag [90]:
	1 = First point reference
	2 = Second point reference
	4 = Third point reference
	8 = Fourth point reference

2018-07-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	configure: add --enable-debug
	to set DEBUG_CLASSES.
	remove -O2 on gcc.

	api: sort dwg.h add api
	fixes perl bindings compilation errors.
	also add a convencience regen-swig-patch target for python.

	HACKING: improve examples/unknown
	See also https://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=9203

	testcases: fix decode_test_LDADD
	need to link more src objects, similar to bits_test and hash_test

	testcases: fix hash_test_LDADD
	need to link to bits and hash explicitly.
	needed with higher optimizations, when some smaller functions are dropped
	and inlined, esp. with clang >= 5.

	SURFACE: rename num_*data fields
	the size of the encrypted data.

	api: add missing dwg_object_to_TYPE converters
	Dwg_Object -> Dwg_Object_TYPE
	previously only for entities, now also for all objects.

	testcases: fix bits_test
	because of the bit_write_TV changes, adding the \0 to the length.

	alive.test: fix for --disable-dxf

	testcases: fix minor warnings

	promote DIMASSOC to UNTESTED

2018-07-26  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add DEBUGGING DIMASSOC
	pretty good, just the last intsect_gsmarker: [BS 92]
	and the handles do look wrong in some cases.

	unknown: fix out-of-bounds write
	detected by valgrind

	unknown: no const struct _unknown_field unknown_dxf
	we write to some fields. crashes on some ELF, with this in .rodata

	.gitgnore: add minor files

	unknown: find TV len+1
	A TV testvalue usually includes the final \0.
	Fix that in bit_write_T{VU} and unknown.
	We find now proper TV instead of TF values, e.g. MATERIAL.name

	protect ASSOCACTION VALUEOUTOFBOUNDS
	with DEBUG_CLASSES

	likewise update the docs
	UNTESTED, DEBUGGING, UNHANDLED, ...

	promote ASSOCDEPENDENCY to UNTESTED
	no errors in the covered examples

	unknown: on picat timeout try again with -g go1
	currently for ACAD_TABLE.pi

	add DEBUGGING ASSOCDEPENDENCY
	looks pretty stable to me, needs a bit more testing

	rename SURFACE to PLANESURFACE, regen.
	add to API,
	add coverage (2004/Surface.dwg, 2018/Surface.dwg),
	add UNHANDLED ASSOCPLANESURFACEACTIONBODY,
	regen unknown.

	unknown: skip duplicates
	the same class and unknown bytes.
	This removed 996 entries.

	unknown: add 2000/Helix.dxf

2018-07-25  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	autogen.sh: clean cached VERSION

	swig_python.patch: redo
	fixing Hunk #6 succeeded at 205945 (offset 13869 lines)
	add -b to patch call for easier redoing the difforig.

	r12: fix decode_entity_preR13
	call decode_entity_preR13 from dwg_add_TYPE, the promised preR13 init
	refactoring.

	r12: set more ent fields
	dwg_decode_TYPE calls dwg_add_TYPE, but decode_entity_preR13 needs
	it before and dwg_add_TYPE clears it. Need to refactor preR13 init

	eed: protect from empty appid->apps
	the handle can be empty now. repro: 2013/ground_plane_outline.dwg

2018-07-24  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode: don't set bitsize_address
	this is needed by encode DWG_ENTITY_END to write
	the bitsize.
	I hijacked it for decode DEBUGGING, but this broke
	dwgrewrite for example_r14.dwg

	dwglayers: ignore DICTIONARY
	as layer_control member. This has no entry_name

	free: fix NULL handles
	don't allocate illegal null handles at all,

2018-06-25  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: add dwg_block_control, dwg_{model,paper}_space_ref
	dwg_block_control is easy, always the first object,
	and also dwg->block_control.
	but the canonical model and paper space headers are a bit tricky to get
	to iterate over it.
	fix the implementations and docs, and use the new API.

	the old api via dwg_obj_block_control_get_model_space from the block_control
	was awful and wrong.

	dwggrep: fix the jit, enable --type, --dxf
	PCRE2_PARTIAL_* needs a compiled index [1] or [2] re function, but we
	compiled only a simple (fast) matcher, so the jit always returned
	PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION.
	i.e. the compile options must match the match options.

	also enable the --type and --dxf option.
	for --type we need to set obj->dxfname globally for each object
	to a const string, no threat.

	substring search works fine though.

	We've put the module name for consistency into the dwg.i

	Both swig-generated files are put into srcdir, not builddir with swig-3.
	With swig-2 I think they are in builddir, as seen on travis.

	add missing dwg_obj_obj methods and
	more missing or wrong obj methods

2018-06-22  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: ref, object rename, harmonization
	rename several API funcs for proper prefixes.
	Dwg_Object* methods are using the dwg_object_ prefix,
	Dwg_Object_Ref* getters use dwg_ref_get_

	dwg_api:
	dwg_obj_polyline_*get_*points(Dwg_Object*) => dwg_object_polyline_*
	dwg_obj_get_*(Dwg_Object*) => dwg_object_get_*
	dwg_obj_object_get_index(Dwg_Object*) => dwg_object_get_index

	dwg_get_type => dwg_object_get_type
	dwg_get_dxfname => dwg_object_get_dxfname

	Add the dwg_object_get_fixedtype API.

	And then rename two uncommon signatures taking Dwg_Object_Ref*.
	dwg.h:
	dwg_ref_get_object(const Dwg_Data *restrict dwg,
	                   Dwg_Object_Ref *restrict ref)
	=> dwg_ref_object
	which clashed with dwg_ref_get_object taking a Dwg_Object_Ref*,
	which was before named dwg_obj_ref_get_object.

	dwg_ref_get_object_relative(const Dwg_Data *restrict dwg,
	                            Dwg_Object_Ref *restrict ref,
	                            const Dwg_Object *restrict obj)

	But all the different ACIS data has in version 2 the same content:
	5: BL + 0d254c8109 + 0: BL, so there must be something else.

	There is EED data attached to it, with 0-2 handles and several code 70 and one 71.
	The handles are to APPID instances: ACAD_OBJECT_CHANGE_GUID and ACAD_STEPID.

	on wrong class_versions, which are usually 0-2

2018-06-19  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add 3BLL type as documented, enable TABLE <= r2007
	BLL uses 3 bits for len, but it is documented to use 3B: 1-3 bits
	stopping at the first 0 bit. Which would leave us with
	0: 0, 10: 2, 110: 6, 111: 7. 100 for 4 or 101 for 5 would be invalid.
	But this documentation is wrong, this encoding is not used for
	REQUIREDVERSIONS, picture_size.

	Add the unused documented variant as 3BLL type.

	Use the old TABLE pre-2010 as STABLE, and as DEBUGGING since r2010+.
	dxf: Use the entity dxfname for variable types: ACAD_TABLE.

	fix SPLINE r2013+
	with splineflags1 & 1 the scenario flips to 2
	fixes example_2018

	add -lm dependency to avoid writing nan values into DXF.
	rather skip wrong values then.

	add SPLINE flag DXF 70 support

2018-06-17  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: SUBCLASS (AcDbText) also for r2018+

	add all the recent dxf improvements,
	dxf: write 5 handle since r11, not r2000+.
	removed unused COMMON_TABLE_CONTROL_FLAGS macro args

	suffix.inc: more strdup decl
	some linux libc still complains about lack of a strdup

	dxf: fix AcDb3dPolylineVertex
	add subclass markers,
	fix the 0 entity names
	put the flag behind the point.

	but acad crashes on import AcDb3dPolylineVertex

2018-06-16  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix LWPOLYLINE closed flag
	interestingly the flag 70 needs to be after the num_points 90
	to have an effect at the closed flag 70 & 1.
	with 90 after 70 closed is ignored, another acad bug

	dxf: more work on mspace hdr
	try several methods to get the right Model_Space header.
	if there's non, just skip the BLOCKS section then.

	dxf: skip MLINE with out_dxf
	looks good, but crashes on acad import

	api: simplify the iterator APIs
	we don't need the last argument, as we can use the object only.
	Just check its type.

	disable TABLECONTENT, TABLEGEOMETRY
	we do have coverage for those now.
	They fail on out_dxf, but only with wrong geom_data substructure values.
	Nevertheless

	dxf: refactor mspace BLOCKS

	dxf: fix BLOCKS for mspace
	Analog to prev. the ctrl->model_space object did not contain the
	default *Model_Space block records, esp. for AEC dwgs.

2018-06-16  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: add missing LAYER flags
	add plotflag 290
	and linewidth 370.

	fatal in AEC dwgs

2018-06-16  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: no DICTIONARY as AcDbLayerTableRecord
	This reveals btw an acad 2018 bug

	Typo in dxfin error message:

	Error in LAYER Table
	Expected 0 LAYER or 0 ENTAB, received 0 DICTIONARY on line 6244.
	Invalid or incomplete DXF input -- drawing discarded.

	0 ENTAB => 0 ENDTAB

2018-06-16  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix BLOCKS for pspace
	the ctrl->paper_space object is empty, we need to use the
	header from the header_vars to get all pspace blocks.

	fixes importing many r2004+ dxfs.

2018-06-16  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: special-case _B binary
	fix DIMASSOC to 280,
	fix some 290 booleans to 0/1,
	wrap 90-99 int32_t to signed ints. there are some -1, -2 values, i.e. MLEADERSTYLE.

	dxf: importing Entity MLINE crashes WIP
	r2004+

	dxf: special-case VALUE_RD
	and use it with points.
	do not rad2deg LWPOLYLINE bulges.

	dxf: enable DXF groups 80
	needed for some xdata. and warn on invalid or unknown
	xdata dxf groups. This fixes 2007/Spline with 80 and 83 BL xdata groups.

2018-06-15  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix r2018 $ACADMAINTVER, AcDbArc
	Arc is a mandatory subclass of Circle

	dxf: fix xdata handle, enable XRECORD

	dxf: fix r2007+ truetype styles
	needs mandatory 1001, 1000, 1071 fields.
	hard-code the 1071 flag to 34 for now.

2018-06-15  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: various fixes LWPOLYLINE, MLINESTYLE, ...
	move DXF parenthandles before the subclass markers,

	add r2010+ vertexids to LWPOLYLINE, fix closed flag bit.

	fix the broken REPEAT_CN macro (broke MLINESTYLE)

	simplify out_dxf: VALUE macro. separate fmt from buf and \r\n.

2018-06-15  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	2007: silence the handle stream logging
	on -v4 pre-r2007. This is only really needed for 2007+
	And there make it look better

	.gitignore: more gcov and sample output

2018-06-15  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: add check-dxf target
	It does not really check the dxf's, but creates a lot,
	for importing checks into acad.

	The real DXF check is in programs.

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix more header vars
	add HEADER_H, CMATERIAL, INTERFEREOBJVS, ...
	XRECORD still crashes acad, though it does look good now.

	dwg: fix some header_vars mischmasch
	esp. TREEDEPTH was off by one, a whole section was off.

	dxf: improve TABLES stability
	A table layer entry can also be a DICTIONARY, skip that then.
	check all types

	decode: skip invalid hash_set 0
	empty handle values are invalid, only appear with unhandled classes.

	dxf: add 330 parenthandle
	it should be under AcDbObject, but is in some cases under the
	subclass.

	dxf: always write a handle
	even for a null handle value. this is needed for
	DICTIONARY pairs

	dxf: r2007+ header fixes
	add several missing header vars

	dxf: 2004+ header fixes
	various, tested with r2007.
	this imports now until "Updating header seed."
	r2010 goes even until DICTIONARY.

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix make dist, skip unreleased test-data files
	The release is made on travis from a fresh checkout.
	But locally, with .git, there can be many unrelated big
	DWG's lying around under test-data.
	Take only the files which are under git.
	With huge DWGs > 40MB make distcheck became unusable.

	This uses some GNU make extension := and $(shell ).  BSD makes understands
	it also.  Comment this out when your special make does not take that.

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxfb: fix header
	and remove logging

	rm more .bak test dwgs
	These were accidentally committed.

	dxfb: add _REACTORS, _XDICOBJHANDLE
	but it fails much earlier, in the header at address 90 with a r2000 DXFB already

	dxf: skip empty xdicobjhandle
	ACAD_XDICTIONARY fields

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: special-case PLACEHOLDER
	this is actually the only fixedtype, not just variable,
	which has no dxfname. checke the type instead.

	DXFIN r2004 still fails, without proper error message.

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: add block iterator
	write the dxf BLOCKS section with all BLOCK .. ENDBLK entities,
	for model space and paper space.

	With these changes we can finally DXFIN (i.e. acad import)
	a full r2000 DXF.

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add dwg to all object/entity spec handlers
	e.g. to access the header vars or to resolve handles

	dxf: fix BLOCK_CONTROL num_entries

	change resolve_handle warning
	from Object not found to Object handle not found.
	This warning is mostly harmless.

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dwg2dxf: allow multiple input files
	add -o to name the output for a single input file only.
	use dwg2dxf *.dwg is so much easier.
	for the single file filter case we already have dwgread.

	restrict regen-man to POSIX only. didn't work without ./ prefix,
	a help2man limitation.

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	in_dxf: extend scanf double
	we still had compiler warnings

	dxf: improve var types RECORD names
	always use the dxfname, not our internal objectname.
	this keeps our names nice, and DXF correct.

	dxf: dxf_cvt_tablerecord with r13 already
	do the allcaps conversion of builtin table names with r13+

2018-06-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	trace: change Unhandled Class object
	to display the object index and handle value, not the position.
	With a handle we can see if it is referenced and compare to the
	subsequent object_map resolver errors

	dxf: remove most minimal
	See [GH #21]. There's not much need for minimal, just
	for writing header and entities. But not for the object fields,
	there are merely version specific.

	dxf: add XDICOBJHANDLE dxf 360

	dwg: move common fields reactors, xdicobjhandle up
	to the common Dwg_Object_Object and Dwg_Object_Entity structs.
	now together with the relevant num_ and binary fields.
	and they don't pollute the entity specific structs.

	dxf: disable XRECORD for now
	and return no error on DUMMY, not DWG_ERR_UNHANDLEDCLASS

	dxf: add reactors to all objects
	even if not used (e.g. not used in each CONTROL table)

	dxf objects: simplify REACTORS
	XDICOBJHANDLE(3) not yet implemented (and unnecessary for now)

	dxf: LWPOLYLINE bulge is also in radian
	I think the DXF group 42 is in degrees. Found no samples yet.

	dxf: convert angles
	add rad2deg to all angles. not yet in_dxf*.c

	dxf: start fixing objects: DICTIONARY*, ...
	fixed DICTIONARY, DICTIONARYWDFLT, PLACEHOLDER, MLINESTYLE (almost).
	set obj->fixedtype when reading.
	ACDBPLACEHOLDER has no SUBCLASS marker in the DXF.
	Some DXF names have a ACDB prefix, maybe rename them back (again).

	dxf: fix REACTORS group -5 => 330
	This fixed reading ENTITIES.
	Now we are struck at the OBJECTS section.

	dxf: move PROXY_OBJECT from variable to switch
	it does not survive the klass 500-num_classes check,
	and leads to an invalid dwg->dwg_class[] access.

	dxf: move 100 AcDbEntity after Reactors

	dxf: BLOCK_RECORD table only r13+
	and check against libdxfrw. oh my, so many mistakes and TODOs.
	we need to get rid of --low again, and fix most minimal checks to
	version checks

	resort the dwg_version_as check
	put the most likely upfront
	as we have a linear search.

	up object_map tracing to -v4 HANDLE

	dwgrewrite: return only critical errors
	as error level result

	fix realloced retval for dirty_refs
	dwg_decode_add_object() does not always realloc anymore.
	only return -1 when it did, otherwise return the uncritical error bits

	ignore CRC mismatch warnings on r2000 for the 1st section
	We really need to know the numbers of setions first, to
	know if its broken or not. These were all false negatives.

	unify CRC mismatch warnings
	print them all in %X hex, not %x or %d

	ignore warnings on invalid handles
	now we get about the same amount of Object not found
	errors as there are unknown/unhandled objects, and someone is
	pointing to it.

2018-06-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: add missing LINE,... pts. POLYLINE special-case
	before r2004 there was no LWPOLYLINE in a DXF,
	only a POLYLINE. need to convert to VERTEX_2D later.

	there was special DXF DECODER/ENCODER logic in the spec
	missing out on the DXF case.

	simplify minimal handling on some objects on the switch,
	not to run into MTEXT again

2018-06-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix VIEWPORT
	add missing fields 68 on_off and 69 id.
	both hardcoded to 1 for now, as it is not stored in a DWG r13+

	dwg2dxf: skip free (filename_out) also
	not needed, unless you are a valgrind enthusaist.

	dxf: fix major DICTIONARY --minimal bug
	with --minimal it just skipped over to MTEXT, and crashed there.

	document compile-time strcmp as valid
	The strcmp with a compile-time # pasted token and a constant is
	really being optimized away at compile-time https://godbolt.org/g/AqkhwL
	Impressive.

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	rename branches, smoke policy
	don't smoke the open work/ branches anymore.
	just master, the tagged pre-releases and any smoke/ branches being worked on.

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	Fix windows cr cr lf
	Ensure fopen wb mode everywhere for DXF.
	The windows msvcrt fwrite adds a \r before every \n, so we get it twice.

	Fixes [GH #17], thanks to Shing Liu @eryar for the report and screenshot.

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	skip free with some programs
	time for 40MB DWG went from 3m to 7s, mostly console-out for the errors.
	This is with the new hash object_map. (without it was 2m)

	forget about valgrind reporting leaks. The kernel frees it better.
	The library is still leak-free of course.
	Closes [GH #18]

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	errors: print even lower errors on success
	don't collapse < CRITICAL to 0 in dwgread, dwgwrite, ...

	stability: low error on obj_string_stream
	which is ignored.
	track dwg_decode_eed and handle errors properly, which could be disturbed by the
	previous obj_string_stream error.

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	hash: fix the resize logic
	add elems for proper fillrate calculation,
	remove the resize size arg, not needed.
	don't realloc the array at resize, use a fresh zeroed space.
	this fixed getting back random wrong values after resize

	added hash tracing

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	hash: allow 0 values
	use HASH_NOT_FOUND -1 as special not found return value,
	ie MAX_INT32.

	hash: use the new hash for the object_map WIP
	to speed up dwg_resolve_handle.
	looks a bit unstable though.

	hash: check against out of memory

	add int hash with linear probing
	written from scratch in 30 minutes.
	we disallow keys and values with 0, as they don't appear in the object_ref map.
	we also don't need to delete keys, so the implementation can do without
	tombstones (key -1), or a NOT_FOUND hash_get return value of -1.

	decode: fix free obj->eed[idx].raw
	because this could be a raw from a prev. idx.

	common.h: docs only

	dxf: strange AcDbText class separator expected
	move the AcDbEntity specific TEXT field upwards.
	skip non-public LWPOLYLINE flag values.

	dxf: move COMMON_ENTITY_HANDLE_DATA to the front
	dxf expects common data, like layer name, ltype, ... before the
	entity-specific subclass marker.
	it's a common AcDbEntity property after all.

	dxf: likewise rename section to table
	HANDLE_NAME does the name look in a table record,
	not a section

	dxf: rename dxf_write_handle to dxfb_cvt_tablerecord
	it's not a handle, it a table record entry.
	it's not a writer, it just converts/normalizes some builtin names.

	dxf: empty ctrl->paper_space with r2010+

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: LTYPE handle 6 => name, not hex
	Now all tables and blocks can be read by acad.

	What other handles are resolved to their name in DXF?
	We eventually need to replace e.g.
	FIELD_HANDLE (DIMTXSTY, 5, 340)
	with
	FIELD_HANDLE_NAME (DIMTXSTY, 5, 340, STYLE)
	to resolve with DXF to the name in the section.

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: adjust control 70, add BLOCK_RECORD
	the BLOCK_RECORD table records are apparently mandatory.
	acad complains when missing.

2018-06-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: always set the global *_control objects
	we need at least the handle for dxf

	dxf: fix TIMEBLL format
	add the double calculation (for the binary dxf).
	fix the trace and DXF output.

	doc: PythonCAD R38 also uses LibreDWG
	http://pythoncad.sourceforge.net/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=r38_roadmap

	dxf: tables are mandatory
	not optional.

	dxf: fix AcDbDimStyleTable
	handle code 105,
	no special-case for num_entries
	add missing group 71

	dxf: progress with tables
	add the missing the layer table subclasses,
	special-case the control handle, and the BLOCK_HEADER name.
	const some objects
	remove all the prev. added RECORD () for the object names.

	dxf: avoid empty numbers
	only strings may be empty. numbers will be changed to 0

	dxf: strip ending .00000000000
	for .0 and .5. It's just a heuristic but catches most cases.
	I don't want to invest much more into this mere beauty issue.

2018-06-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix wrong LTYPE type description
	which has DXF type 3, not 48.

	add a check to avoid empty numbers, only allowed for strings.
	rather print 0 then

2018-06-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	check-dwg-valgrind: less verbose, small files only
	we only care for segfaults, not the field tracing.
	the log file already gets huge.

	restrict check-dwg-valgrind to DWGs size < 10M,
	check-dwg-valgrind to size < 40M.

2018-06-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	alive.test: rm core file
	writers may create core files, which may fail the distuninstall test

2018-06-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix reading huge files
	Fixes reading DWG files >40MB with many elements exceeding
	the previous hardcoded limits. E.g. this example had
	789388 objects and 2453916 object refs.
	Note that the decompressed sizes are bigger than the filesize,
	roughly by factor 2.0.

	It is really slow though.
	The object_refs hash table really improves it from 2m to 5s.

2018-06-09  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	move classes dispatcher into common.inc
	no various copies around. Now the variable typed classes
	are maintained in one and only place. Just the static ones have
	copied switch tables, but this number is fixed. There will be no
	new ones, so I'm fine with that.

	sort classes.inc by stability, entity, and names.

2018-06-09  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	major varying classes refactor
	abstract away the several types of class stabilities in the switch dispatcher:
	stable, untested, debugging and unhandled.
	In the next commit we will extract the class dispatchers into one single
	classes.inc.
	free is now a bit slower because of the dynamic strcmp dispatcher
	checks, but we win in massive consistency improvements. This could also be
	improved later by switching to dynamic enum/int checks.

	fix typo: DICTIONARYWDLFT => DICTIONARYWDFLT,

	add HELIX

	set obj->fixedtype, to the fixed enum DWG_OBJECT_TYPE, which is
	independent on the class index. then you don't need to check the dxfname
	anymore, and we can possibly get away with all the strcmp dxfname.
	This must be enforced by all importers (in_dxf*, ...) also.

	collapse the various SURFACE types to one SURFACE entity,
	in DXF there's only one SURFACE entity.

	Fixed various dead-code issues in VBA_PROJECT, MULTILEADER. Some latest
	changes were hidden behind DEBUG_*. Now not anymore.

2018-06-09  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	appveyor: deploy as pre-release
	not as draft anymore. They are stable enough to warrant
	official nightlies. Such a pre-release creates a tag,
	which triggers a travis make dist deploy.

	Before I had to manually trigger each drafted release,
	which you didn't see. Now it goes directly to public pre-releases.

2018-06-08  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: cleanup from prev. errors refactor

2018-06-08  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	rename AcDbField to FIELD, tested ok

	num_childs occurs twice. the first is unreliable. if >0 dec by one.
	but really num_childval 93 is better.

	FIELD and FIELDLIST are now tested ok.

	errors: add DWG_ERR_CRITICAL for programs
	Don't report errors if less severe than DWG_ERR_CRITICAL.
	i.e. DWG_ERR_VALUEOUTOFBOUNDS.
	Same for the high-level dwg API: dwg_read_file, dwg_write_file
	dxf_*_file.

2018-06-08  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	errors: pass through decode/encode/print/...
	The errors are now severity sorted bitmasks, and we pass it all through,
	just not the bits API, as this is functional without *error retval.
	We don't stop on any coding error, we just accumulate the error bits.

	Every dwg_TYPE_##token function returns now an error code.
	Flip the dwg_TYPE_variable_type() logic to return 0 on success
	and DWG_ERR_UNHANDLEDCLASS to switch to UNKNOWN_*

	Fix the annoying in_dxf char** warnings.

	dwg.h: fix some _RC to _BS
	only done in the spec previously with 323efd78ea,
	so we had a mismatch. only detected on windows.

	fix windows deploy: not the libtool wrappers
	Fixes #15
	The windows make install does not put the proper binaries into bin,
	so we went and copied it manually. But the wrong ones.

2018-06-06  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	extend xmlsuite
	add support for a couple of more elements, in fact
	all elements found in the prepared XMLs used for this test.

	Even some custom class Helix, which doesn't have a graphical
	representation in the DWG, only a class definition.

2018-06-06  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	docs: update Copyright headers
	for all recent significant changes

	windows: add declspec(dllimport)
	for external programs linking to the dll, ie
	where DLL_EXPORT is not set (libtool does this for us).

	doc update
	and rename the CRC field in header_variables
	to crc, to match the docs. Only uppercase matches DXF vars.

	free: FREE_IF objects

	dwgrewrite: default to r2000, stability
	write: don't error on empty fields or handles.

	more objects: GEOPOSITIONMARKER, CAMERA
	and some minor fixes: PLOTSETTINGS, MATERIAL.
	CAMERA should not be in any DWG, but maybe in a DXF or other format.
	rename some PLOTSETTINGS fields for consistency with LAYOUT.
	some crosschecks with the oarx docs.

	more plausible SUN fields
	light reorder. problem is that we don't have a SUN object in any
	DXF yet, just the class. will do that later.

2018-06-06  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	more SUN
	found documentation. it's not a table entry (no name),
	it's rather a singleton.
	now we have 46 bits unknown bits left (some doubles: direction,
	altitude, azimuth?), and the order is yet unknown.

	fix MATERIAL RC to BS types.
	add some more SUBCLASS markers from newer DXFs

2018-06-05  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add SUN, OBJECT_PTR
	SUN misses 11 byte/3 bit. OBJECT_PTR not yet tested

	add unsorted fields for PLOTSETTINGS, LIGHT
	dxf: add all the missing dxf SUBCLASS markers (with help from the ARX docs),
	  also table control objects.
	add field docs for PROXY_ENTITY, LWPOLYLINE, MLINESTYLE,
	fix dxf output for LWPOLYLINE (with bulges and widths),
	rename WIPEOUTVARIABLE to WIPEOUTVARIABLES

	api: 3dsolid, spline, mline, dictionary
	several api fixes.

2018-06-04  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	2007: fix section_string_stream for overlarge data_size
	The overflow logic with hi_size was wrong. Too small type.

	We can now read many AEC drawings with a data_size > 0x8000
	and >300 classes. E.g. Autodesk Architectural Desktop 2007.
	But some of them are still problematic.

	Allow reading r2010+ now with a tarball release, and enable

	stability:
	  skip tables/vectors with more than 0x1000 entries: REPEAT,
	  reactors.
	  fix entity picture size (IMAGE, WIPEOUT) from BLL to BL, but this is
	  still buggy for 2010+. skip it.
	  skip empty table names.
	  dxf: skip unknown objects and tables, i.e. some newer VIEWSTYLE tables.

	test: skip the DXF comparison check, as it is not ready yet.
	the diff became too large.

2018-06-03  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	2010: fix the remaining stream offsets
	harmonize entities with objects.
	Now most fields can be read, just a few are broken.
	The 2010 DWGs itself report success.

	2010: add UMC unsigned type for handlestream_size
	and revert the old object map offsets to signed MC.
	This fixes now most Objects, just one still broken.
	Now Entities are left.

	bits: fix MC type to unsigned
	it cannot be negative at all.
	Fixes the r2010+ objects with negative Hdlsizs,
	but broke many earlier dwgs.

	2010: fix object hdlpos
	+ 8.
	Now just the bit_read_MC is broken, sometimes returning negative values.

	2010: fix object bitsize calculation
	8*size - handlestream_size
	the object string stream is now correct, missing just the handle stream offset.

	2010: fix Header offsets
	The string and handle offsets are also correct now.

2018-06-03  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	We have to jump through absurd hurdles in the API to get around that.
	The parent points to the _dwg_object_{entity, object}, which points

	Add all the add functions to encode.c/.h (later eventually to dwg_api.h)

	rename DWG_TYPE_3DSOLID to DWG_TYPE__3DSOLID for consistency (to create it by type)

	Create the objects from an empty/zeroed Bit_Chain stream.  Suppress all

	fix FIELD_VECTOR: LWPLINE bulges,
	avoid 330 handles and 100 names with minimal.

	but we still get a eNullHandle assertion on ACAD import.

2018-05-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	* programs/dwg2dxf.c:
	dwg2dxf: fix -m --minimal arg processing
	on another note: acad will crash with our -m dxf file so far :(
	we need to minimize it a bit more.

        * src/out_dxf.c:
	dxf: skip empty TABLE_CONTROL null_handles

2018-05-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	* src/out_dxf.c: dxf: fix duplicate 5 handles
	we emit the owner 5 handle already with DWG_OBJECT for all objects,
	skip it for COMMON_TABLE_CONTROL_FLAGS and COMMON_TABLE_FLAGS.

	acad import still fails at table APPID

	dxf: oops
	delete a .bak test-data file

	dxf: fix VPORT aspect_ratio 41
	The real aspect_ratio needs to be divided by the viewsize,
	since r13 at least. <=r12 stores the real aspect_ratio already.

	dwg2dxf: fix printing as version
	to stdout not stderr

	dxf: use more dxf_write_handle conversions
	also for the name in COMMON_TABLE_FLAGS, as those names
	also need conversions.
	also add *Active

	dxf: $MEASUREMENT is r14 already
	simplify the logic also

	dxf: $UCSBASE is r2000+ only

	dxf: write even empty names/strings

2018-05-26  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: abstract HANDLE_NAME to dxf_write_handle

	STANDARD to Standard, BYLAYER to ByLayer, BYBLOCK to ByBlock.

	also check that the table name is really an object, not an entity.

2018-05-26  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: add examples in more versions
	sample_2000.dwg in r14-2018 DXF formats
	example_2000.dwg in 2018 dwg and dxf formats

	alive.test: add filt_dxf.pl

	fixed some wrong VPORT fields: sun_handle -> shade_plot_handle 333 (vport owns these)
	view_twist_angle -> view_twist for consistency
	aspect_ratio 41 is still wrong
	view_twist 50 -> 51
	back_clip 33 -> 44

	also fix the common table format a bit
	allow DXF groups in the spec

2018-05-25  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: support Standard in HANDLE_NAME

	dwg_decode_handleref_with_code: fix null pointer dereference

	for now only suppress clang warnings, gcc not yet.
	(only tested until gcc-6 on macports. no idea about gcc-8)

	rename VP_ENT_{HDR,CONTROL}

	Analog to block use VPORT_ENT_CONTROL and VPORT_ENT_HEADER.

	rename {ucs,block,view}_control_handle to *_control

	TODO: NOCOMMA and \n not with stdout. stdout is line-buffered

2018-05-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	encode: add RESET_VER
	cur_ver should be reset after after SINCE/... version check block,
	otherwise e.g. handles are not printed.

	We are stuck with this syntax without the block in the macro, so try
	to add these RESET_VER wherever it is missing.

2018-05-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	encode: fix HANDLE
	reset wrong cur_ver to allow printing handles

	add dxf codes for FIELD and GEODATA.
	support codepage 29: ANSI_1251

	dxfb: more types and harmonize
	the goal should be a header_vars_dxfout.spec, with typed fields, like HEADER_RC.
	but maybe it can even serve for dxfin also, looping over all available names.

2018-05-09  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	advance to the next object, don't reset to start start address.
	previously objects were overwriting each other.
	calculate size, and adjust if wrong. users cannot be expected to

	Now only bit_write_handle is broken, and several object sizes are off.

2018-05-09  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	encode: simplify bit_write_MS
	this is just a very simple RLE encoded int, with the highest bit

	We can only use wchar.h when on Windows with a sizeof 2.
	On unix wchar_t is a 4-byte UTF-32.
	How to handle these? Use native wchar_t internally
	and convert when reading/writing?

	add ctype.h probe

	fix eed packed struct
	some gccs add intermediate bytes into the Eed_Data struct,
	esp. mingw.

2018-04-07  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix wrong encode class checks

	fix -Wsign-compare

	use bits _TF functions
	for larger strings/raw data. esp. for later conversion to FIELD_TF
	and LOG_TRACE_TF.

	eed rewrite
	EED are really a stream of size+app-handle + sequence of app-specific code+value pairs,
	not just one code+value per handle.
	So add a new eed struct per code+value pair, and leave the size empty of subsequent
	eeds, and re-use the handle.

2018-04-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fixed some r14 second header parsing
	adjust for num_sections, which now actually matches the documentation

	more TODO

	Merge branch 'dxf' into work
	separate examples and programs.
	many improvements and fixes, esp. some objects, memory leaks and eed.

	Update TODO for the finished dxf branch

	fix get_first_owned_object
	with no BLOCK_HEADER entities, e.g. empty paperspace.

	fix MLEADERSTYLE eed
	wrong usage of index i, used twice, nested.
	rename the inner appid loop to j,
	the outer eed loop to idx.

	more auxheader: still debugging
	add some helpers: DEBUG_HERE() and LOG_TRACE_TF (fixed string)

	Makefile.am: fix check-dwg targets

	free: add dwg_free_handleref
	where we lookup the handle in the global list of refs
	and delete it there also.
	also free the reactors, defer freeing BLOCK_CONTROL,
	and set a freed obj->type to DWG_TYPE_FREED, to skip
	double-frees

	Fix reamining warnings
	proper casts for preR13 types,
	warp TODO objects into ifdef DEBUG_<OBJECT>
	change IMAGE.clip_mode from BS to B ??

	de-arm CRC check

	XRECORD: write and free the objid_handles
	free the object_ref array.

2018-04-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add check-dwg-valgrind

	free: dup klass->dxfname
	because freeing an object could free the dxfname also.
	and some cases are unhandled.

	VISUALSTYLE tested ok

	test VISUALSTYLE

	harmonize defined but disabled classes
	CELLSTYLEMAP also.

	fix more gcc-7 warnings
	-Wint-in-bool-context: compute the TABLE field num_cells. we use it twice.
	-Wsign-compare in some eed DEBUG sanity checks

	build: document missing check-valgrind
	for the alive.test hack. switch to a normal
	runtest env, which does have valgrind support

2018-04-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix MLEADERSTYLE is_new_format
	add global dwg->appid_control, a list of all registered apps.
	when an MLEADERSTYLE eed handle points to a ACAD_MLEADERVER APPID, then
	use the new MLEADERSTYLE format (because it was imported from a newer version).
	Fixes the text_always_left bit offset.

	add dwg_resolve_handleref helper, a part of the handle decoder.

	rename MLEADER to MULTILEADER, the dxf really has the MULTILEADER name,
	libdwg uses it also.

2018-04-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	use int32_t, not long int to create nan.
	we still avoid to link against libm,
	even the dwg_api should not do anymore.

	second_header: fix sections overflow
	Leader_2000 has 6 sections there, not just 4

	alive.test: dwgbmp Leader_2004 will always fail
	because it has no embedded picture and it then returns -1

	decode: fix ubsan problems

	TODO: we already decrypt the raw SAT data. we only might want to
	parse it into some SAT structures.

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	EED done
	inline the EED char buffers.

	* configure.ac: probe for wchar.h needed for r2007+ text.
	* src/dwg.h (Dwg_Eed_Data): inline the buffers, and comment that the
	  integers need to be endian swapped for the API, if they need to be
	  interpreted. They are still in network order. But mostly just dump the
	  raw. Swap the codepage.
	  (Dwg_Eed): Dwg_Eed_Data *data is now a calloc'd pointer, not inlined.
	* src/bits.h: add <wchar.h>, needed for a unit-test.
	* src/decode.c, src/encode.c: use the changed Dwg_Eed_Data.
	  add length sanity checks and offset deviations. special-case eed_0 strings.

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	EED: add dwg_encode_{object,entity} to encode WIP
	also write common_entity_handle_data,
	comment out unused objects and the proxy subtype. src compiles now warning free.

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	rewrite EED (untested), more common entity support
	Fix multiple instances of EED.
	It it either stored as array, but more likely as linked list.
	Anyway, we need to store it as array of structs, not as linked list.
	But for sure not as the next EED overwriting the previous.

	* src/common_entity_handle_data.spec: Add support for more entity
	  fields R_2010+: simplify nolinks, add color_handle, add
	  has_*_visualstyle R_2010+.
	* src/dwg.h: add Dwg_Eed_Data, Dwg_Eed structs, num_eed + Dwg_Eed *eed in
	  entity and object, add color_handle, *_visualstyle.
	* src/decode.c (dwg_decode_entity, dwg_decode_object): add num_eed,
	  minor rewrite of eed.
	  add RLL support for picture_size R_2007+, add has_*_visualstyle R_2010+.
	* src/encode.c (dwg_encode_entity, dwg_encode_object): likewise.

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	  fix the paperspace limits calculation: LIM not EXT.
	  use double, not float.
	* examples/dwg_ps.c: use double, not float.

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	more work on R2010 objects
	And assert on invalid section/page sizes and counts.
	all r2007_file_header values for r2010 are still invalid.
	for 2007 only some.

	* src/decode.c (dwg_decode_data): enhance version mapper to all.
	  simplify the warn and error messages for unknown versions.
	  (resolve_objectref_vector): return success code.
	  (decode_R2004): delete unused File Header Data fields, now parsed via spec (also encodable).
	* src/decode_r2007.c: add DBG_MAX_COUNT, DBG_MAX_SIZE asserts.
	* src/dwg.h, src/dwg.spec: more R2010+ fields for ATTRIB, ATTDEF, DIMENSION*.

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode: demote some LOG_ERROR to LOG_WARN
	they are harmless mostly. libdxfrw just ignores them and much more.
	And LOG_ERROR should really panic, not continue.

	rename examples, dwg prefix
	all this to be able to use bin_PROGRAMS for faster
	debugging cycles, without tests or long cmdlines.
	anyway: rewrite => dwgrewrite, test => dwgread,
	testSVG => dwg2SVG, testsvg2 => dwg2svg2, get_bmp => dwgbmp

	Makefile.am: build examples before the tests
	often we need to test via an example before running the full
	testsuite

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix the dxfname, no final *
	the last char is always \0, don't replace it with *.
	the len BS includes the final \0, but we keep that.
	we only store the ASCIIZ anyway.

	also don't replace unprintable chars with ~.
	we do support encode and codepages conversion later.
	with codepages isprint() is relative.
	thus unprintable chars can only be replaced in temp. print helpers.

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix auxheader, trace types
	* src/auxheader.spec: RS unknown[10] => RS unknown_rs[6] + RL zero_l[5],
	  print unknown_rs as hex.
	* src/dwg.h: print RC as 0x%hhx and BB as %uc.
	* src/logging.h: add final \n to LOG_ERROR and LOG_WARN.
	* src/dec_macros.h: trace the types also. needed for analysis.

	fixup make distcheck for test-data
	TODO: txttoxml.py: if built from a non-writable srcdir writing
	to the srcdir/test-data/*.xml will fail. eg make distcheck
	The XML must be written into the builddir.

	travis: add python-libxml2

	decode_r2007: use inttypes

	add RLL type support.
	be strict about BITCODE_BS, BITCODE_BL types.

	Note that the raw RS RL ... types are not native raw. They are network-encoded,

	Reed-Solomon (255,239) codec.
	Two routines, rs_encode_block() and rs_decode_block() are provided.
	The first will encode a block, depositing the 16 parity bytes in a

	are errors it optionally fixes them in place using the Euclidean
	algorithm. Two example programs are provided to demonstrate.

	[w] Writing objects to bitstream correctly - or at least almost.
	* encode.c: fixed dwg_encode_chains() to call dwg_encode_add_objects() at the correct point, plus various fixes.

	It seems that some files are now written correctly to the bitstream. Although, unknown object types and objects with variable type (>500) are still skipped.
	I have also detected various situations in which the Header Variables and Classes sections of the new file are 2 bytes longer than the original file. Comparing both original and re-written files, I suspect that bit_write_CRC() is writing these two extra bogus bytes.

2009-09-17  Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches  <juca@members.fsf.org>

	huge refactoring in SVG generator. Now symbols are stored in <defs> (we are using the BLOCK_HEADER handles)
	But I am still not sure about the correct procedure to select the entities that must be put inside a <g>.
	I tried to get all objects from first_entity until last_entity as they appear in the file, but that does not seem to be
	correct. What is the correct way to iterate over entities?

	R_2004+ provides a vector of handles pointing to everything that must go inside a <g>, but prior versions only tell us the
	1st and last entities.

2009-09-16  Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches  <juca@members.fsf.org>

	fixing the issue described on previous commit.

2009-09-16  Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches  <juca@members.fsf.org>

	refactoring our code that handles handles. I have noticed that we are probably having leak issues here. But I still didn't detect exactly what is wrong. Handles are correctly parsed, but their values are corrupted before they are used by client code. Something is messing with our object_ref vector.

2009-09-16  Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches  <juca@members.fsf.org>

	correct decoding of BLOCK_CONTROL.
	Now it will be possible to create <defs> section in SVG because BLOCK_CONTROL keeps handles of all BLOCK_HEADERS in the
	file and so we can loop these and read their BLOCKS and output one <g> for each simbol

	This commit totally ROCKS!!!

	hmmm! And we are in svn revision 256!!!! HAPPY HACKING! :-D

2009-09-16  Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches  <juca@members.fsf.org>

	them is still not working because our current implementation of dwg_decode_handlerefs is wrong. The
	block_header_handle in an INSERT object is placed ***after*** "Common Entity Handle Data" section. So, cloning will
