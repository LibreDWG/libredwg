LibreDWG version 0.11 - planned 2020/06 - beta:

New features:
  * new programs dwgfilter, dxfwrite.
    dwgfilter allows custom jq queries.
    dxfwrite allows version conversions, which dwgwrite does not yet support.
  * Can now read all 2004+ section types: added AppInfo, FileDepList,
    Template, ObjFreeSpace;
    and as blob: RevHistory, Security, AppInfoHistory.
    AcDsPrototype_1b datastore not fully yet, so we cannot reliably yet read
    new ACIS r2013+ SAB blobs stored there, but we extract them from the AcDs
    blob by brute-force.
  * Added new string types: T and T16, TU16, T32 (for those sections)
  * Convert ACIS BinaryFile v2 SAB to old encrypted ACIS SAT v1 data, needed
    to convert pre-r2013 ACIS v2 entities to DXF.
  * Added support for many object/entity types:

    Fixed PROXY_OBJECT, PROXY_ENTITY.
    Demoted to Unstable: SPATIAL_INDEX
    Demoted to Debugging: PERSSUBENTMANAGER DIMASSOC

    Note: Unstable objects are not preserved via DXF conversion, just the external import
    is supported.

    Add most Constraint (ASSOC*) and DYNBLOCK objects (BLOCK*).
    Debugging classes added (needs --with-debug option):

  * Started support to write r2004+ format DWG's (which includes also r2010,
    r2013, r2018, but not r2007), but this does not work fully yet.
  * Added all remaining Dwg_Version types: R_1_3 for AC1.3, R_2_4 for AC1001, and
    AC1013 for R_13c3.
  * The header can now be compiled wth C++ compilers, needed for some bindings.
    Re-arranged nested structs, names, malloc casts, reserved keywords like this,
    template.
    Started with the gambas bindings, a Visual Basic clone for unix.
  * DXF and JSON importers now create PLACEHOLDER objects for unsupported
    objects.
  * 3DSOLID got now material properties and revisionguid fields.
  * Many parts of the API are now auto-generated/updated: dwg.i, dwg_api.c, dwg_api.h,
    unions and setup in dwg.h
  * Added geojsonhint or gjv linter support. Fixed all violations (esp. point arrays,
    and POLYLINE_2D). Add a Feature id (the handle)
  * Added support for GeoJSON RFC7946, write closed polygons, re-order by the
    right-hand rule..
  * new API functions:
    dwg_ctrl_table, dwg_handle_name, dwg_find_dicthandle_objname, dwg_variable_dict,
    dwg_next_entity, get_next_owned_block_entity, dwg_section_name,
    dwg_version_type, dwg_version_as, dwg_errstrings,  dwg_rgb_palette,
    dwg_find_color_index.
  * new dynapi functions: dwg_dynapi_subclass_value, dwg_dynapi_subclass_field,
    dwg_dynapi_fields_size.
    (BTW. the dynapi proved to be a godsend for the json importer)

API breaking changes:
  * Renamed dwg_section_type to dwg_section_wtype, added a new dwg_section_type
    for ASCII names.
  * Removed all extra null_handle fields, and add the missing handle fields.
  * Renamed all dwg_add_OBJECT functions to dwg_setup_OBJECT. They didn't add them, just setup
    the internal structures.
  * Renamed VPORT_ENTITY_HEADER to VX_TABLE_RECORD and VPORT_ENTITY_CONTROL to VX_CONTROL.
    Also section enum SECTION_VPORT_ENTITY to SECTION_VX and dwg->vport_entity_control likewise.
  * Hundreds of field renames due to harmonization efforts with the more generic
    JSON importer. Note that some deprecated dwg_api accessor functions were also
    renamed accordingly, but not all.

    For the stable objects:

    Type changes in stable objects:
    SPLINE.fit_pts are now ordinary BITCODE_3DPOINT*
    SPLINE.color is BL, scale is now 3BD
  * Changed truecolor attributes in GeoJSON with a # prefix.

Major bugfixes:
  * Fixed converting ASCII from and to Unicode strings, when converting across
    versions. Embed Unicode as \U+XXXX into ASCII, and decode it back to Unicode.
    Honor dat,dwg->from_version and use the new FIELD_T as seperate type. (#185)
  * Invalid numbers (read failures) are converted to 0.0 in the released version.
  * Fixed wrong CMC color reads and writes, check the method, lookup the index,
    support a CMTC truecolor-only type.
  * Fixed EED writes, by writing to seperate streams and merging them at the end,
    with proper size calculation.
  * All remaining assertions are now protected. (GH #187)

Minor bugfixes:
  * Fixed uncompressed sections overflows, some fuzzed (GH #183), some
    with the new sections.
  * Normalize extrusion vectors.
  * Fix bit_write_BT, the thickness vector pre-R2000.
  * Added many overflow checks, due to extensive fuzzing campains.
  * Fixed wrong julian date conversions with TIMEBLL types.
  * Fxed keyword conflicts with the bindings: No next, from, self fieldnames.
  * Many more, see the ChangeLog.

Other newsworthy changes:
  * Harmonized 2004 section search with the better 2007 variant. Added a new
    section and info fixedtype field.
  * Added unit-tests for all supported objects.
  * Added src/classes.c defining the class stability (stable, unstable, debugging, unhandled).
  * Need now -lm, the system math library, in all cases.
  * Got a complete collection of old DWGs to cross-check against. Many new object types
    could be stabilized because of this. Many thanks to Michal Josef Špaček.
  * CMC color got 2 new fields: raw (EMC only), method (the first rgb byte).
  * Many DXF re-ordering fixes.

Notes: The new constraint and dynblock objects just miss a major refactor into seperate
impl subclasses, and subent and curve support.

LibreDWG version 0.10.1 - released 2020/01/13 - beta:

Major bugfixes:
  * Fixed dwg2SVG htmlescape overflows and off-by-ones (#182)
  * Removed direct usages of fprintf and stderr in the lib. All can be
    redefined now. (#181)

Minor bugfixes:
  * Fuzzing fixes for dwg2SVG, dwgread. (#182)
  * Fixed eed.raw leaks

LibreDWG version 0.10 - released 2020/01/08 - beta:

API breaking changes:
  * added a new int *isnewp argument to all dynapi utf8text getters,
    if the returned string is freshly malloced or not.
  * removed the UNKNOWN supertype, there are only UNKNOWN_OBJ and UNKNOWN_ENT
    left, with common_entity_data.
  * renamed BLOCK_HEADER.preview_data to preview, preview_data_size to preview_size
  * renamed SHAPE.shape_no to style_id
  * renamed CLASS.wasazombie to is_zombie

Major bugfixes:
  * Improved building the perl5 binding, proper dependencies.
    Set proper -I and -L paths, create LibreDWG.c not swig_perl.c
  * Harmonized INDXFB with INDXF, removed extra src/in_dxfb.c (#134).
    Slimmed the .so size by 260Kb. Still untested though.
  * Fixed encoding of added r2000 AUXHEADER address (broken since 0.9)
  * Fixed EED encoding from dwgrewrite (a dxf2dwg regression from 0.9) (#180)

Minor bugfixes:
  * Many fuzzing and static analyzer fixes for dwg2dxf, dxf2dwg, dwgrewrite,
    including a stack-overflow on outdxf cquote. (#172-174, #178, #179).
    dwgrewrite and indxf are pretty robust now, but still highly experimental,
    as many dxf2dwg import and DWG validity tests are missing.
    indxf still has many asserts on many structural DXF errors.
  * Protect indxf from many NULL ptr, overflows and truncation.
  * Fixed most indxf and encode leaks. (#151)
  * More section decoders protections from invalid (fuzzed) values.
  * Stabilized the ASAN leak tests for make check.
  * Fix MULTILEADER.ctx.lline handles <r2010
  * Fix indxf color.alpha; at DXF 440
  * Fixed most important make scan-build warnings, the rest are mostly bogus.

Other newsworthy changes:
  * Added LIBREDWG_VERSION et al to include/dwg.h
  * Added support for AcDb3dSolid history_id (r2007+)
  * Improved the indxf speed in new_object. Do a proper linear search, and
    break on first found type.
  * Rename the ./dxf helper to ./dwg, and added a ./dxf test helper.
  * dxf2dwg got a new experimental --force-free option to check for leaks and
    UAF or double-free's.
  * Allow -o /dev/null sinks for dxf2dwg and dwg2dxf, for faster fuzzing.
  * Harmonized *.spec formatting and adjusted gen-dynapi.pl
  * Harmonized out_dxfb with out_dxf, e.g. the new mspace improvements (#173).

LibreDWG version 0.9.3 - released 2019/12/25 - beta:

Minor bugfixes:
  * Added several overflow checks from fuzzing (#176)
    CVE-2019-20009, CVE-2019-20010, CVE-2019-20011, CVE-2019-20012,
    CVE-2019-20013, CVE-2019-20014, CVE-2019-20015
  * Enabled AX_RESTRICT, undefining restrict in broken compilers (#141)
  * Fixed AX_ADD_FORTIFY_SOURCE warnings with gcc-9 -Wcpp
  * Disallow illegal SPLINE scenarios (#176)

LibreDWG version 0.9.2 - released 2019/11/08 - beta:

new API:
  * Added the -x,--extnames option to dwglayers for r13-r14 DWGs,
    displaying the extended variants with spaces. Since r2000 only
    those "extended" names are stored. (#167)

Minor bugfixes:
  * Fixed some leaks: SORTENTSTABLE, PROXY_ENTITY.ownerhandle for r13.
  * Add DICTIONARY.itemhandles[] for r13 and r14
  * Fixed some dwglayers null pointer derefs, and flush its output
    for each layer. (#166)

Other newsworthy changes:
  * Add geom utils to some programs: dwg2SVG and dwg2ps to transcode
    points via its OCS (i.e. extrusion vector)
  * Add basic POLYLINE_2D and LWPOLYLINE support to dwg2SVG. no arcs (bulges),
    no other curve_types (spline, bezier), no widths.

LibreDWG version 0.9.1 - released 2019/10/28 - beta:

Minor bugfixes:
  * Fixed bit_read_4BITS, off-by-one for the first bit.
  * Fixed more null pointer dereferences, overflows, hangs and memory leaks
    for fuzzed (i.e. illegal) dwg's.
  * Fixed some more compiler warnings.
  * Workaround stricter CPU's with ALIGNED_ACCESS_REQUIRED.
  * Add -fstack-protector for newer mingw, to link -lssp, which is now mandatory
    for _FORTIFY_SOURCE (a mingw-w64 libc headers bug).
  * Do not use gcc-9.0 - gcc-9.2! This series is seriously broken, not
    just for this project.
  * dwg2SVG: honor TTF font styles => Verdana or Courier (#156)

LibreDWG version 0.9 - released 2019/10/6 - beta:

new API:
  * Added the dxf importer, using the new dynapi and the r2000 encoder.
    Status: experimental. Only for r2000 dxf's yet.
  * Added utf8text conversion functions to the dynapi:
    dwg_dynapi_header_utf8text, dwg_dynapi_entity_utf8text,
    dwg_dynapi_common_utf8text converting unicode strings to UTF-8.
    And it's higher level variants: dwg_{g,s}et_HEADER_utf8text,
    dwg_{g,s}et_{ENTITY,OBJECT}_common,
    dwg_{g,s}et_{ENTITY,OBJECT}_common_utf8text,
    dwg_ent_{g,s}et_UTF8.
  * Added the missing dwg_dynapi_common_set_value.
  * Added dwg_dynapi_handle_name helper.
  * Added to unstable objects: TABLESTYLE, TABLE.
    TABLE r2018+ now includes TABLECONTENT.
  * Added SummaryInfo section.
  * Added 3DSOLID encoder.
  * Added API's to find handles for names, searching in tables and dicts.
  * Added TIMERLL type. raw, unencoded 2xRL julian date, for SummaryInfo.
  * Added signed d variants to some types: BLd, BSd, RLd, ...
    and x formatters: RLx.
  * Added reverse dxf_revcvt_lweight().

API breaking changes:
  * Added an is_utf8 arg to the dynapi setters:
    dwg_dynapi_header_set_value, dwg_dynapi_entity_set_value,
    dwg_dynapi_common_set_value, converting UTF-8 strings to TV or TU.
  * Generalize object handles:
    * Rename common field ownerhandle, esp. not NAME_control 330.
    * Remove various null_handle fields.
    * Rename LTYPE.null_handle to LTYPE.extref_handle
    * Add SORTENTSTABLE.dict_handle (previous called ownerhandle,
      it IS the ownerhandle. ok, there we do have both, the parenthandle
      and the ownerhandle)
    * Remove xrecord,proxy get_ownerhandle API
    * Move ownerhandle to parent Object_Object along reactors and xdicobjhandle.
      This field is common to all objects. (#118)
    * Remove unneeded ownerhandle fields.
    * Renamed STYLE.null_handle to STYLE.extref_handle
  * Changed DIMASSOC spec
  * Minor POLYLINE/VERTEX field fixups for DXF. add COMMON_ENTITY_POLYLINE.has_vertex 66,
    add VERTEX_PFACE_FACE.flag 70.
  * Renamed two LAYOUT fields: pspace_block_record => block_header,
    last_viewport => active_viewport.
  * Harmonize DICTIONARY_NAMED_OBJECT (NOD) names:
      LAYOUTS => LAYOUT, PLOTSTYLES => PLOTSTYLENAME, MATERIALS => MATERIAL,
      COLORS => COLOR.
  * Renamed all linetype* fields to ltype.
  * Removed IMAGE/WIPEOUT boundary_pt{0,1} fields. Use clip_verts[0,1] instead.

Important bugfixes:
  * Fixed all remaining null pointer dereferences and memory leaks. We added
    a smoke with asan, ubsan and lsan. Only the dxf importer is leaking.
  * Fixed dwg_dynapi_common_*
  * Fixed get_next_owned_entity, which omitted the last entity for r13-r2000.
    (#143)
  * Fixed the UCS-2 to utf-8 converter, causing corrupt DXF with unicode names
    and strings. (#143)
  * Fixed wrong object address (#112). handlestream_size is not part of obj->size.
    This fixes the hdlpos += 8 FIXME's and many handles.
  * Fixed FIELDLIST standard handles (#118)
  * Fixed FIELD.childs and objects (#117)
  * Fixed MLINESTYLE.ltype handles (#116)
  * Fixed MULTILEADER content_block (#113)
  * Added many missing handles 2007+ (#115)
    Due to the fixed handle_stream offset, we can now reliably read many
    more handles (#114):
      DIMENSION_ORDINATE
      DIMENSION_LINEAR
      DIMENSION_ALIGNED
      DIMENSION_ANG3PT
      DIMENSION_ANG2LN
      DIMENSION_RADIUS
      DIMENSION_DIAMETER
      MTEXT
      BLOCK_CONTROL
      STYLE
      SORTENTSTABLE
      APPID
      DICTIONARYVAR
      VPORT_ENTITY_HEADER
  * Fixed OLE2FRAME encoder.
  * Fixed EED code 5 as int64 (#110)
  * More stable eed decoder with overflow, e.g. when dat does not advance error earlier.
    Avoid endless loops on eed decoding errors.
  * Various minor improvements in the dxf writer. (#143)
  * Major improvements in the dxf reader. Most r2000 entities and many objects
    can be imported, and read from acad dwg's.
  * Various minor improvements in the dwg writer, esp. calculating the object
    size and bitsize. fixed bit_write_4BITS (for VPORT.VIEWMODE)
  * Protect all sizes from VALUEOUTOFBOUNDS with sensical values.
    (i.e. new size restrictions)

Other newsworthy changes:
  * Restricted the three dat, hdl_dat and str_dat streams in its size and
    offset to the current object to detect every overflow. And report this
    overflow.
  * Read COMMON_ENTITY_HANDLE_DATA earlier, so that we can remove extra 2nd
    handle loops at the end for r2007+ (#85)
  * Support reading uncompressed sections (e.g SummaryInfo)
  * Added -y/--overwrite flag to most programs.
  * Better LOG_TRACE [rcount1], [rcount2] logging, expanded to the actual
    index.
  * Removed the dejagnu based test/testcases, merged with proper
    test/unit-testing
  * With the new dxf importer, a lot of logic had to be added for missing fields,
    calculating them, adding defaults, and support dxfname aliases.
  * Harmonized internal REPEAT macro names.
  * Added decode code to recover from invalid HANDLES handleoff UMC or offset MC.

LibreDWG version 0.8 - released 2019/6/25 - still alpha:

new API:
  * added a new dynamic API, read and write all header and object fields
    by name. Many of the old dwg_api.h field accessors are deprecated.
  * add calculated DIMENSION.flag from flag1 and flag2
  * add BITCODE_UMC type for Object-map section_handles
  * add reverse dwg_find_objectref lookup: linear search, only done for
    entities with subentities to find the ref for the current object.
  * added to stable: UNDERLAY entities, UNDERLAYDEFINITION, CAMERA objects

API breaking changes:
  * rename get_first_owned_object to get_first_owned_entity,
    get_next_owned_object to get_next_owned_entity.
  * Changed these iterators in handling subentites (VERTEX, ATTRIB),
    these are now skipped.
  * rename <TABLE>.entry_name to name (#76)
  * rename VPORT.shade_plot_handle back to sun_handle, dxf 361
  * rename POLYLINE_3D.flag2 to curvetype, dxf 75.

  * rename ent->parent to ent->ownerhandle (#82)
  * replace ENTITY.subentity by ownerhandle 330
  * rename _ent->entity_mode to entmode (as in ODA)

Important bugfixes:
  * dwg.h now always includes stdint.h and inttypes.h, no more
    int vs int32_t confusion
  * Fixed many errors in DXF output:
    * split BLOCKS and ENTITIES (#88)
      esp. in respect to Paper_Space (#81) and Model_Space entities.
    * DICTIONARY: fix hard_owner DXF 350/360.
    * Fix xdata dxf groups: +1000 or XRECORD.
    * Fix block names (#81), take it from its linked BLOCK entity
    * Fix DIMENSION blocknames, ditto (#81).
    * Fix c-quote of strings with different quoting rules than json.
    * Fix _3DSOLID,_3DFACE dxfname and 3DSOLID, BODY subclass names
    * Add missing DIMSTYLE 3 handle
    * Support DXF elevation and extrusion as pt,
    * Add dxf.test to be shell compatible
    * convert CELWEIGHT and linewt values (#79)

      MSPACE record.
    * fix colors a bit
    * print HANDSEED as hex (#71)
  * Fixed JSON output, add tests with jq. just not yet via pipes (NOCOMMA hack).
    make HEADER a hash, better ARRAY, POINTS, VECTORs, c-quote strings.
    Resemble more to the DWG structure, not DXF: Rename ENTITIES to OBJECTS,
    TODO: FILEHEADER sections (#76)
  * Validate decoded and sort DXF output of entities with subentities
    (POLYLINE, INSERT) (#83). In DWG they have different orderings,
    fixup some off-by-one decoding errors (e.g. wrong handle stream offset).
  * Fixed HATCH gradientfill color (#89)
  * decode: set proper ->dxfname from classes.inc, Fixes ACDBDICTIONARYWDFLT
    DXF object and simplifies out_dxf.
  * Fix some CRC checks: RSx vs RS_LE, add unused crc64 code.
  * More overflow and free protections added by Denis Pruchkovsky
  * Extend read/write bit_MC/UMC from 4 to 5 bytes (denis #70, PR #65)
    This is broken in all other dwg libraries.
  * Fix bit_convert_TU for >U+800 (#80)

  * add cirrus FreeBSD smoker
  * rename dxf_example.{lsp,sh} to dxf-allcvt.*
  * add dxf-roundtrip.sh, via TeighaFileConverter

LibreDWG version 0.7 - released 2018/12/6 - still alpha:

new API:
  * add dwg_get_OBJECT(dwg) API for all objects in a DWG.
    analog to dwg_get_ENTITY, but including all objects, tables,
    block headers, even if unowned.
  Note that the dwg_api will be revamped from static to dynamic before 1.0.
  field accessors will be by name argument and ... (va_args)
  See the work/dynapi branch #59 (in progress).
  dwg_get_OBJECT(dwg) will be renamed to dwg_getall_OBJECT(dwg),
  dwg_get_ENTITY(blkhdr) to dwg_getall_ENTITY(blkhdr).

API breaking changes:
  * Changed BITCODE_RC from signed to unsigned char (#44)
  * LEADER changes: rename hooklineonxdir to hookline_dir,
    rename unknown_bit_4 to hookline_on,
    endptproj only until r2007. (but still not 100% correct)
  * MULTILEADER changes: rename num_vertex to numpts (analog to LEADER),
    change vertex to points[] (PR #49 Denis Pryt)
  * Fixed dwg_get_ENTITY(hdr): NULL-terminate the result (#60)

Important bugfixes:
  * Fixed all memory leaks and double-free's (#43, #42, PR #58 Denis Pryt)
  * Fixed EED sizes (PR #48, Denis Pryt)
  * Fixed BLOCK_HEADER.num_inserts, esp. with xref's (#44).
    For decode and encode.
  * Fixed LTYPE.dash (#44)
  * Fixup LEADER DXF values and path_type with annot_type mixup.
  * Fixed TABLE.value.data_type with flags kGeneral (#54 Denis Pryt)
  * Fixes VECTOR_CHKCOUNT segfault on unassigned obj->dxfname's
    (esp. for <=R12), and fix overflows (#56)
  * dwglayers: fix for DICTIONARY breaking the list output (#51)
  * dxf: fix dxf_blocks_write for empty paper_space (#52)
  * Fixed example/load_dwg.py allowing non-critical error codes

Other newsworthy changes:
  * Check for RUNNING_ON_VALGRIND and call dwg_free then, even
    if previously skipped.
  * Renamed all remaining API "null malloc" error messages to
    "Out of memory"
  * Harmonized in_dxfb with in_dxf, but still WIP


LibreDWG version 0.6.2 - released 2018/11/07 - still alpha:

Important bugfixes:
  * Fixed several out_dxf segfaults (#39)
  * Enhanced the section size limit from 2032 to 2040.
    There were several DWG files with a section size of 2035
    in the wild. (PR #41, Denis Pryt)
  * Fixed EED realloc on decoding when end - dat->byte == 1
    (PR #41, Denis Pryt)


LibreDWG version 0.6.1 - released 2018/11/05 - still alpha:

Important bugfixes:
  * fix wrong FIELD_2DD_VECTOR in dwg decode (#40).



LibreDWG version 0.6 - released 2018/08/13 - still alpha:

API breaking changes:
  * Removed dwg_obj_proxy_get_reactors(), use dwg_obj_get_reactors() instead.
  * Renamed SORTENTSTABLE.owner_handle to SORTENTSTABLE.owner_dict.
  * Renamed all -as-rNNNN program options to --as-rNNNN.

Other newsworthy changes:
  * Removed all unused type-specific reactors and xdicobjhandle fields,
    use the generic object and entity fields instead.
  * Added signed BITCODE_RLd and BITCODE_BLd (int32_t) types.
  * Added unknown_bits field to all UNSTABLE/DEBUGGING classes.
  * Custom CFLAGS are now honored.
  * Support for GNU parallel and coreutils timeout logfile and picat processing.

Important bugfixes:
  * Fixed previously empty strings for r2007+ for some objects and entities (#34).
  * Fixed r2010+ picture size calculation (DXF 160, 310), leading to wrong entity offsets.
  * Added more checks for unstable objects: empty handles, controls, overflows, isnan.
  * Fixed some common_entity_data, mostly with non-indexed colors and gradient filled HATCH
    (#27, #28, #31)
  * Fixed some proper relative handles, which were previously treated as NULL handle.
  * Fixed writing TV strings, now the length includes the final \0 char.
  * Fixed the initial minimal hash size, fixing an endless loop on very small
    (truncated) DWG's (<1000 bytes).
  * Much less memory leaks.
  * Improved free, i.e. no more double free with EED data. (#33)
  * Better perl bindings build support on Windows, prefer local dwg.h over
    installed dwg.h on testing (#29).
  * Fixed dejagnu compilation on C11 by using -fgnu89-inline (#2)

New features:
  * Added unstable support for the objects ASSOCDEPENDENCY, ASSOCPLANESURFACEACTIONBODY,
    DBCOLOR, DIMASSOC, DYNAMICBLOCKPURGEPREVENTER, HELIX, LIGHT, PERSSUBENTMANAGER,
    UNDERLAYDEFINITION and the entities MULTILEADER, UNDERLAY.
  * Added getopt_long() support to all programs, position independent options.
  * Implemented examples/unknown to find field layouts of unknown objects.
    With bd and bits helpers to decode unknowns.
    Now with a http://picat-lang.org helper. See also HACKING and savannah News.
  * Implemented parsing ACIS version 2 to the binary SAB format.
  * Added all missing dwg_object_to_OBJECT() functions for objects.
  * Added dwg_ent_minsert_set_num_cols(), dwg_ent_minsert_set_num_rows()
  * Added --disable-dxf, --enable--debug configure options. With debug there are many
    more unstable objects available.
  * Added libredwg.pc (#30)
  * Added valgrind supressions for known darwin/glibc leaks.
  * Changed and clarified the semver version numbering on development checkouts with
    major.minor[.patch[.build.nonmastercommits-gittag]]. See HACKING.


LibreDWG version 0.5 - released 2018/07/05:

This is the first public release ever, after several years of silence.
It can read most r13-r2018 DWG files, and write r2000 DWG,
write DXF and GeoJSON files for all versions.
There are also many new programs: dwgread, dwgwrite, dwgrewrite,
dwg2dxf, dwglayers, dwggrep, dwgbmp, dwg2SVG (very basic), dwg2ps (infancy).
See the manual, ChangeLog or git history for details.

The API is usable but still pretty rough, we might still rename
some functions or names for better consistency and add more encoding API.
