HACKING LibreDWG

"???" means that there is still some question to resolve;
someone should probably think about and resolve them!

* regen

  To regenerate the configure script and Makefile.in files,
  change to the top-level directory and do: "sh autogen.sh".
  Make sure you have recent Autoconf, Automake, Libtool installed.
  (See comments in autogen.sh for specific versions tested.)

* other tools

  Aside from the the autotools (see "regen", above),
  you will also need GNU Texinfo to build the manual.

* coding standards

  We try to follow the GNU Coding Standards, with some exceptions.
  - from Emacs: (info "(standards)")
  - from shell: $ info standards

  The exceptions are:
  - [[change log maintenance]]
  - [??? other]

* change log maintenance

  Presently, there is only one top-level ChangeLog file, and commits go
  in without updating it.  Once we get to (??? SOME-MILESTONE), we plan
  to generate ChangeLog entries at release time based on the commit logs.
  We use the script create-changelog (in build-aux/) for that.

  This means that as of (??? START-DATE) the commit logs should follow
  the GNU Coding Standards.  For example:

  | Add foo, with increased bar.
  |
  | Normally, we don't need to foo, but sometimes it is necessary.
  | In those cases, we might as well use a bigger bar.
  |
  | * src/part.h (foo): New decl.
  |   (bar): Bump value of this #define to 42.
  | * src/part.c (foo): New func.
  | * src/main.c (main): In the case of `sometimes', call `foo'.
  | * test/special.test (normally): Don't test `sometimes'.
  |   (sometimes): New test case.
  | * doc/whole.texi (Special Cases): Document `sometimes' handling.

  This example has three parts: a one-line sentence describing the change,
  followed by two newlines, followed by a short discussion of the change,
  followed by entries for each of the five changed files.  A template:

  | ONE-LINE SENTENCE
  |
  | DISCUSSION
  |
  | * CHANGES-TO-FILE
  | [...]

  For small changes or when the one-line sentence suffices, the discussion
  (and its following two newlines) can be dropped:

  | ONE-LINE SENTENCE
  |
  | * CHANGES-TO-FILE
  | [...]

  There are some conventions for the one-line sentence:

  - Suffix "; nfc." means no functional change (e.g., changing comments only).
    This causes create-changelog to omit the entry from its output.

  - Prefix "[TOPIC]" means this change is about some TOPIC.
    Some topics we use are:
    - admin  -- administrative stuff (e.g., this file)
    - build  -- configuration, makefiles, etc
    - r      -- read path (decoding)
    - w      -- write path (encoding)
    - bind   -- language bindings
    - api    -- user API
    - doc    -- documentation
    - v      -- validation ("make check" stuff)
    - [??? more topics here]

* [??? other exceptions]

* trailing whitespace

  Don't be uncool; avoid introducing trailing whitespace!  See:
  <http://old.nabble.com/Re:-whitespace-cleanup-p6850253.html>

* branch name

  If you want to push a branch that may be "git rebase"d in the future,
  either use the prefix "wip-" (work in progress), or your Savannah
  username followed by a slash (e.g., "juca/").

* using gdb with programs in examples/

  The programs in examples are built by libtool and dynamically linked
  against the pre-installed library by using a wrapper script.  To run
  them under gdb, use:

  $ libtool --mode=execute gdb PROGRAM

* etc
#+STARTUP: odd
  Local variables:
  mode: org
