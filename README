LibreDWG

LibreDWG is a free C library to read and write DWG files.  This program is
part of the GNU project, released under the aegis of GNU.  It is licensed
under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (or at you option
any later version).

DWG is a file format created in the 70's for the emerging CAD applications.
Currently it is the native file format of AutoCAD, a proprietary CAD program 
developed by AutoDesk.

LibreDWG is a fork from LibDWG due to its usage of Esperanto, which we
think is not the best strategy for a free software project which aims
to get lots of contributors.  LibreDWG is written in English.  At the
moment our decoder is almost done, just some R2007+ streams and
pre-R13 entities fail to read.  Among the example applications we
wrote using LibreDWG is an initial SVG conversion and a DWG rewrite,
i.e saveas tool. Please contact us if you can help.

The program dwg_ps (in examples/) reads DWG and outputs Postscript; it
depends on pslib: <http://pslib.sourceforge.net>.  In many GNU/Linux
distributions, this is available by installing the pslib-dev package.
If the configure script does not find pslib, dwg_ps will not be built.

Sometimes we hang on our IRC channel which is #libredwg at irc.freenode.net

== Building and installing the library ==

You need the following dependencies:
- Basic development tools (gcc/clang, autoconf, automake and libtool)
- SWIG 1.7+
- Python development headers (debian: python-dev; yum: python-devel)
  and the libxml2 python bindings.
- TeXinfo for building the docs

See INSTALL for generic instructions.  Basically, you do:

$ ./autogen.sh (if you checked out the source code from git)
$ ./configure [--enable-trace] [--enable--write]
$ make
$ make check    # optional but strongly encouraged while LibreDWG is alpha
$ sudo make install

This builds and installs various files in the "installation dirs":
  $libdir     ($exec_prefix/lib)   -- library files (libredwg.*)
  $includedir ($prefix/include)    -- dwg.h dwg_api.h
  $infodir    ($datarootdir/info)  -- LibreDWG.info

Use "./configure --help" to see a full list of options you can use to
customize the installation dirs.  Other options recognized by configure are:

  --enable-trace

    Enable runtime tracing (default: no).  When enabled, the environment
    variable LIBREDWG_TRACE is consulted on the first decode/encode attempt.
    Its value is an integer: 0 (no output) through 9 (full verbosity).

  --enable-write
  
    Enable write support (default: no). When enabled, you activate the write
    support for the dwg format.
    This is an experimental feature that is under construction, so it's
    highly unstable.

== Example usage of the library ==

The programs and examples directories contains some application code that uses our lib:

* dwgread -- A simple DWG reader.

* dwgrewrite -- Reads a DWG, writes it back under a different name and optionally
  under a different version, and re-reads it back for confirmation.
  Under construction, only with --enable-write.

* dwg2dxf -- Converts a DWG to a DXF (ascii or binary), optionally
  under a different version. Under construction.

* dxf2dwg -- Converts a ascii or binary DXF to a DWG, optionally
  under a different version. Under construction.

* load_dwg -- This is a skeleton code, reading the DWG and adding an entity.
  Look there if you want to have a quickly glance on how to use the library.

* dwg_ps -- Opens a DWG file and outputs an PostScript file.  This code
  depends on the PSlib library.  On Debian-based systems this is usually
  available as a package named pslib-dev.

* dwg2SVG -- Opens a DWG file and outputs an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
  file.  SVG is a W3C standard for 2d vector graphics.  You can open these
  files on several free software tools.  We recomend Inkscape, a free software
  vector graphics editor.  The dwg2SVG program will not handle 3d content
  from DWG since SVG only supports 2-dimensional images.

* dwgbmp -- Extracts the bmp thumbnail of a dwg file when it is available.

* xmlsuite -- an extensive example library to use the SWIG python bindings
  is in the test/xmlsuite directory.
