/* This program is an encoder/decoder for Reed-Solomon codes. Encoding is in
   systematic form, decoding via the Berlekamp iterative algorithm.
   In the present form , the constants mm, nn, tt, and kk=nn-2tt must be
   specified  (the double letters are used simply to avoid clashes with
   other n,k,t used in other programs into which this was incorporated!)
   Also, the irreducible polynomial used to generate GF(2**mm) must also be
   entered -- these can be found in Lin and Costello, and also Clark and Cain.

   The representation of the elements of GF(2**m) is either in index form,
   where the number is the power of the primitive element alpha, which is
   convenient for multiplication (add the powers modulo 2**m-1) or in
   polynomial form, where the bits represent the coefficients of the
   polynomial representation of the number, which is the most convenient form
   for addition.  The two forms are swapped between via lookup tables.
   This leads to fairly messy looking expressions, but unfortunately, there
   is no easy alternative when working with Galois arithmetic.

   The code is not written in the most elegant way, but to the best
   of my knowledge, (no absolute guarantees!), it works.
   However, when including it into a simulation program, you may want to do
   some conversion of global variables (used here because I am lazy!) to
   local variables where appropriate, and passing parameters (eg array
   addresses) to the functions  may be a sensible move to reduce the number
   of global variables and thus decrease the chance of a bug being introduced.

   This program does not handle erasures at present, but should not be hard
   to adapt to do this, as it is just an adjustment to the Berlekamp-Massey
   algorithm. It also does not attempt to decode past the BCH bound -- see
   Blahut "Theory and practice of error control codes" for how to do this.

   26/6/91 Slight modifications to remove a compiler dependent bug which hadn't
           previously surfaced. A few extra comments added for clarity.
           Appears to all work fine, ready for posting to net!

                 --------
   This program may be freely modified and/or given to whoever wants it.
   A condition of such distribution is that the author's contribution be

decode_rs ()
/* assume we have received bits grouped into mm-bit symbols in recd[i],

   We first compute the 2*tt syndromes by substituting alpha**i into rec(X) and
   evaluating, storing the syndromes in s[i], i=1..2tt (leave s[0] zero) .
   Then we use the Berlekamp iteration to find the error location polynomial
   elp[i].   If the degree of the elp is >tt, we cannot correct all the errors
   and hence just put out the information symbols uncorrected. If the degree of
   elp is <=tt, we substitute alpha**i , i=1..n into the elp to get the roots,
   hence the inverse roots, the error location numbers. If the number of errors
   located does not equal the degree of the elp, we have more than tt errors
   and cannot correct them.  Otherwise, we then solve for the error value at
   the error location and correct the error.  The procedure is that found in
   Lin and Costello. For the cases where the number of errors is known to be
   too large to correct, the information symbols as received are output (the
   advantage of systematic encoding is that hopefully some of the information
   symbols will be okay and that if we are in luck, the errors are in the
   parity part of the transmitted codeword).  Of course, these insoluble cases
   can be returned as error flags to the calling routine if desired.   */
